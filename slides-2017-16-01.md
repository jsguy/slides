# Choosing a web UI framework/library

There are numerous factors you need to consider when choosing a web UI framework or library - the foremost consideration is: do you want a native-rendering or virtual-DOM based framework. A DOM (Document Object Model) based framework typically modifies the DOM directly, and can only be used in Browsers, whereas a virtual-DOM based framework will render through an intermediary step before committing the changes to the real DOM. The ramifications of choosing one vs the other can be widespread, and can affect many aspects of your development and deployment lifecycle. There are various methods to evaluate a framework, all of which can be classified as either objective or subjective, in this article we will discuss some aspects of both categories.

## Do you want a framework or a library?

A library is a collection of functions and or objects that serves a particular purpose. A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries to help with building an application. The questions to ask are:

* Do you need the flexibility that comes with choosing a library over a framework?
* Are you able to take on board the extra work that will be required to use a library, as it will not provide everything that you need.

Of course a framework comes with it's own set of tools and quirks that your development team will need to take on board, the main benefit of a framework is that it solves most of the common tasks and issues that a developer needs to solve when developing an app.

## Subjective evaluation methods

These evaluation methods will be specific to the entity evaluating the frameworks/libraries, and the outcome of each method might provide more value for one organisation over another. For example if your deadlines are usually really short, you might value expressiveness over maintainability.

### Maintainable, Expressive, Performant

I like the aphorism: "Cheap, Fast, Good - choose any 2" - we can apply similar criteria when assessing frameworks:

* Maintainable - how easy is it for [any developer][3] to modify and keep the UI up to date, aka: "Cheap"
* Expressive - how quickly can a developer get a solution out the door, aka: "Fast"
* Performant - how well does the UI perform, especially when there are multiple levels of nested UI components, aka: "Good"

Pick any two. This criteria is quite dependent on the experience that individual developers have with a particular framework, and it can be quite subjective how we measure each - however for this discussion, we will assume the user has some experience in each of the frameworks and can comfortably create a UI widget from scratch in any of the libraries/frameworks.

### Business related considerations

When evaluating a framework or library, consider what the business needs - do you want to create a large library of customisable components that will be re-used in various flexible scenarios, or do you have a more narrow scope, such as web-only, and maybe just re-used in a few, more common scenarios. Make sure you pick something that fits the level of expertise of the developers - are they expert Front-enders, or are they more all-round full-stack developers?
Also consider how quickly you need to be able to develop bespoke solutions - this is particularly important when looking at [certain libraries][1], as they tend to encourage the developer to break components down into relatively small parts, which can be quite time consuming, though more (forcibly) testable, and hence robust in the long run. Such strictness is great if you 1000s of developers, and have time to write tests and build scripts, in a smaller team this is considered a luxury that there is often not enough resource/time to implement.
At the same time, some of the more [popular libraries][7] have a very [large amount of components][6] available for use, which may be quite useful.


## Objective evaluation methods

### Popularity

See how much a framework/library [is used][9], so that you can gauge what the community thinks of it.

* Available UI components
* Backing (Company)
* Community help Available

### Integrations

You may need to integrate your new framework/library with existing sites, and each will have a unique set of integration points, it is worth looking at what your integration point needs are, and how they might be affected by your UI framework/library decisions. For example if you add in a framework/library that requires building each time something is changed, you inherently add to the development time - it might only be 10 - 15 seconds extra build, but that is more than enough for a developer to lose concentration.

### Level of control

With any UI framework or library you lose control of certain things such as:

* Compatibility with browsers
* Direct access to the DOM
* Good control over certain performance aspects
* Performance tuning options can be framework/library specific

### Overheads

Some of these technologies come with certain overheads that need to be considered, such as:

* The download size of the base framework, and what the means for your users
* Capabilities for optimisation without needing to "hack" the framework functionality


## Case studies

When selecting a UI framework, you really need to choose at least two things

* The underlying framework or library, eg: React, jQuery, Knockout, Mithril, Angular, etc...
* The UI library that runs on top of the underlying framework or library, eg: material-ui (React), jQUery UI, Bootstrap (jQUery), Polythene (mithril), etc...

Sometimes you can also find adaptors, or [write your own adaptor][8], which means you can mix and match

The selection of both of these will have a profound effects on how your development cycle looks, and also how your app is built and deployed.
